# My Web Page

Hi there! This is my personal web page. I have created this web page using [vCard](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio.git). I made some changes to the original code to make it more personal. I hope you like it! 

The main purpose of this webpage is to host simulations related to physics, share study material for new students, and to share my personal projects.
