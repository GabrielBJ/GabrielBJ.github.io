### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### About me

I am a bachelor student in physics at Yachay Tech University, Ecuador. I am interested in the filed of condensed matter physics for quantum computing, and computational physics.

I created this website to share my research and interests in the aforementioned fields. Additionally, I will be posting some of my notes and thoughts on different topics in physics.

I am in my last year of my undergraduate studies, and I am currently working on my thesis project, and I am excited to share my progress and results with you.
